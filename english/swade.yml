  TOURS:
    AMMUNITION:
      Title: Ammunition
      Description: This Tour will show you how to use automated ammunition tracking
      Actor: Ammunition Tour Demo Character
      Items:
        NONE: Longbow
        SELF: Throwing Knife
        SINGLE: Revolver
        FULL: Water Gun
        MAGAZINE: Steyr AUG
        BATTERY: Laser Gun
        PP: Wizard Gun
      GameSettings:
        Title: Game Settings
        Content: >-
          First, Ammunition Tracking must be enabled in the game's system
          settings.
      SwadeSettings:
        Title: SWADE Settings
        Content: >-
          Ammunition settings are found in the <em>Savage Worlds</em> setting
          configurator
      AmmoSettings:
        Title: Ammo Settings
        Content: These control if ammo is automatically consumed by ranged weapons.
      AmmoManagement:
        Title: Ammunition Management
        Content: >-
          This setting controls whether firing a ranged weapon consumes any ammo
          at all, either from the weapons' internal shot counter or from
          inventory.
      PCInventory:
        Title: Ammo from Inventory
        Content: >-
          The next three settings control if external items are consumed when a
          weapon reloads, based on the actor type. If these are unchecked but
          ammunition management is checked, actors of a given type will consume
          the shots on an item but can freely reload. This allows for
          arcade-style ammo management where the reload action is important to
          track but long-term ammo usage is not.
      CharacterWeapons:
        Title: Character Weapons
        Content: A character's weapons are listed in the gear tab.
      ReloadNone:
        Title: Reload Procedure â€” None
        Content: >-
          These weapons ignore the shots counter entirely, pulling directly from
          the linked ammo item. This setting is best for weapons that only use
          external ammo, such as a quiver of arrows or a drum-fed gattling gun.
      AmmoNone:
        Title: The Ammo Field
        Content: >-
          This should be set to a gear (e.g. Arrows) or consumable item (e.g.
          Barrel of Bullets) in the character's inventory. A gear item's
          quantity is consumed directly. Consumable items use their charges
          instead, with each quantity representing a full set of charges. This
          field must match the name of the item to be consumed <em>exactly</em>.
      ReloadSelf:
        Title: Reload Procedure â€” Self
        Content: >-
          These weapons use their own quantity to reset their shots counter.
          This setting is best for thrown weapons or anything else that is
          self-contained and uses itself up.
      AmmoSelf:
        Title: The Ammo Field
        Content: This field is ignored when the reload type is set to self
      ReloadSingle:
        Title: Reload Procedure â€” Single
        Content: >-
          These weapons reload a single shot with each press of the Reload
          button. This setting is ideal for revolvers or other weapons with
          bulky pieces of ammunition that are slow to reload.
      AmmoSingle:
        Title: The Ammo Field
        Content: >-
          This field works similarly to Reload â€” None, but quantity or charges
          are consumed by reloading instead of by firing the weapon, as firing
          the weapon consumes from the Shots counter.
      ReloadFull:
        Title: Reload Procedure â€” Full
        Content: >-
          These weapons reload their entire shot counter with each press of the
          Reload button. This can be used as a simplified version of the
          Magazine method or for weapons that don't have detachable magazines,
          such as a gun with liquid reservoirs.
      AmmoFull:
        Title: The Ammo Field
        Content: >-
          This field works similarly to Reload â€” None, but quantity or charges
          are consumed by reloading instead of by firing the weapon, as firing
          the weapon consumes from the Shots counter.
      ReloadMagazine:
        Title: Reload Procedure â€” Magazine
        Content: >-
          These weapons use fully detachable magazines that can be swapped as
          needed, tracking the amount of shots left per magazine.
      AmmoMagazine:
        Title: The Ammo Field
        Content: >-
          The item named here MUST be a consumable with the Magazine subtype to
          work correctly. Furthermore, the charges of the consumable should
          match the shots counter of the weapon.
      ReloadBattery:
        Title: Reload Procedure â€” Battery
        Content: >-
          These weapons operate similar to magazines, but with interchangeable
          batteries that are depleted proportional to the shots spent.
      AmmoBattery:
        Title: The Ammo Field
        Content: >-
          The item named here MUST be a consumable with the Battery subtype to
          work correctly. Furthermore, the maximum charges of the consumable
          should be out of 100.
      ReloadPP:
        Title: Reload Procedure â€” Power Points
        Content: >-
          These weapons don't reload with physical ammunition but by depleting
          the wielder's power points, as featured in <em>RiftsÂ® for Savage
          Worlds</em>
      AmmoPP:
        Title: The Ammo Field
        Content: >-
          Instead of naming an item, name a valid arcane type on the character,
          such as general, magic, miracles, or psionics
    TWEAKS:
      Title: Tweaks

        Content: >-
          This tab provides a large array of additional fields that customize a
          character's traits
      Advances:
        Title: Advance Mode
        Content: >-
          Expanded advances (the default) bring enhanced data handling that
          specify the type of advance and automatically calculate your
          character's rank. Legacy advances are simply a large text box to write
          whatever you want with no data handling.
      Unshake:
        Title: Unshake Modifier
        Content: >-
          Adds a bonus to the automated shake roll that's prompted at the start
          of a shaken character's turn.
      Soak:
        Title: Soak Modifier
        Content: >-

          button on the system's damage roll cards.
